# My First React-Native App (ToDo List):

> Status: Version: 1.0.0

Well, I decided that in 2023 I'm going to learn React-Native, since last year I focused a lot on Front-End, learning Next.js in this case, why not focus a little on Mobile Development :)

Because I already have experience with React.js in web development, my learning curve is being reasonably pleasant

anyway, the project is a simple ToDo List with the basics of <code>useState()</code> Hook

## Technologies:

- React-Native
- React-Navigation (Drawer)
